Model Accuracy Gini: 0.7229
Model Accuracy Entropy: 0.7273
Question 1: No the resulting models are not the same, as there is a 0.0043 difference in their accuracy. Entropy is shown to have a little bit of a better performance than Gini index, because Entropy had an accuracy score of 0.7273 while Gini had 0.7229.
Question 2: Based on the accuracy results the Entropy model is the better model, however since the difference is negligible both models roughly perform similarly in this case.
