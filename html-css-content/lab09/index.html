				<h2>The Hidden Cost of Captivity</h2>
				<p>Orcas have long been featured in marine parks and films, but behind the spectacle lies a troubling reality. From Namu, the first captive orca to spark public fascination, to Keiko, the real-life whale behind Free Willy, their stories reveal the true cost of captivity.</p>
			</div> <!-- .section -->

			<div class="section" id="light-blue">
				<h2>Namu: The Orca Who Changed Everything</h2>
				<p>The capture of Namu marked a turning point—shifting public perception from fear to exploitation. Though he appeared playful, captivity stripped him of his freedom, confining him to a life far from the open ocean. His story was just the beginning of a complex and often heartbreaking relationship between humans and wild orcas.</p>

				<h2>Namu, My Best Friend: A Misleading Tale</h2>
				<p>The 1966 film Namu, My Best Friend painted a touching story of friendship between an orca and a marine biologist. Audiences were led to believe that orcas and humans could form deep bonds in captivity, but reality told a different story. Behind the scenes, Namu suffered from stress, an unnatural environment, and declining health—facts left out of the film’s narrative. The movie made him famous, but it also masked the ethical concerns of keeping these majestic creatures in tanks.</p>

			<div class="section soft-teal">
				<h2>Keiko & Free Willy: A Movie That Sparked a Movement</h2>
				<p>The beloved film Free Willy told the story of a captive orca’s escape to freedom, inspiring millions to care about whales. But the real-life orca who played Willy—Keiko—remained in captivity, suffering in a small, unhealthy tank in Mexico City.</p>

				<p>Public outcry grew as people learned of Keiko’s dire condition. Over 300,000 people signed petitions demanding his release. In 1995, the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation raised $7 million, allowing him to be relocated to the Oregon coast. There, he swam in real ocean water for the first time in years, regained his health, and prepared for life in the wild.</p>
		
				<h2>The First Captive Orca to Be Freed</h2>
				<p>In July 2002, Keiko became the first captive orca to be released back into the ocean. His journey proved that freedom was possible—but also highlighted the deep issues within marine entertainment.<p>

				<p>The question remains: How many more orcas will endure a life of captivity before change happens?</p>
