Question [1] - 'optimal' k:  10
Question [2] -  no, the clusters don't directly represent the quality of wine
Question [3] - The reason is that because we're comparing the patterns of features that the wines were clustered into using KMeans, which has no relation to the quality of wine, since the clustering is not based on the quality of wine. So we're essentially comparing the original quality of wine with the clusters generated by the KMeans algorithm, which won't align with one another because the clustering is based on different features than quality of wine.
